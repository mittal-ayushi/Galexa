The project is an exoplanet sky visibility simulator running in the cloud, where you can simulate what the sky would look like from any position in our galaxy, including exoplanets around other stars. For educational as well as entertainment purposes, this is an engaging way into understanding astronomy and astrophysics hands-on in a very interactive and visual approach.
